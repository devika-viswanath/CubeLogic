![Rubik's Cube Math](https://media.tenor.com/kNG5K3Ech14AAAAC/rubiks-cube.gif)

> A project exploring the Rubik's Cube using concepts from **Group Theory**, **Permutations**, and **Algebra**.

## Overview

This project is a deep dive into the mathematical structure behind the Rubik's Cube. It demonstrates how the cube’s movements form a non-abelian group, and explores theoretical frameworks such as:

- Permutations
- Cube group structure
- Subgroups and Cosets
- Lagrange's Theorem
- Cayley Graphs
- Word and Presentation Problems

## Table of Contents

1. Preliminaries  
2. Group Theory on Rubik’s Cube  
3. The Cube and the Word Problem  
4. Methods of Solving the Cube  
5. Conclusion

## File Included

- `group_theory_on_rubiks_cube.pdf` – Full project document with definitions, proofs, examples, and solving techniques.
